        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Website is a portal where my wife and I can share our most loved recipes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of these recipes have been gathered through our years together and added in a little recipe book my
            wife cherishes very much. When I was asked in the module to create an actual website, I thought that it was
            the perfect occasion to bring all those recipes from the book to the web, so that we could share them with
            friends and family.
        </p>
        <p>
            When designing the website, I wanted to have a simple structure with a navigation Menu at the top and the
            content underneath it. The website has a home page and then 4 pages categorized by meal type (starters, main
            dishes, everything that is part of baking and desserts).
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to make sure that my wife and I could upload new recipes easily, so when designing the website, I
            created a template engine for the recipes. The recipes are found in a .js file called recipes.js and are
            saved as Objects. To add or remove a recipe it's sufficient to modify that .js file. When the webpage is
            loading it will load all the appropriate recipes from the file and the template engine in JavaScript will
            create a card for each recipe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recipes are loaded in each page as cards having a picture, a title, and a description of the recipe. If you
            click on the recipe card it will expand showing more in detail the ingredients and the steps to cook the
            recipe. All of the pictures come from freestock images websites or have been taken with a camera from me.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the bottom of the web page there is a standard footer. I followed my wife's preferences and chose a
            palette of greys, coral and white colours.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="report-container" id="inspiration">
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
            My first inspiration would be my wife, she cooks amazing dishes for the whole family. Cooking is a great
            passion of hers and you can feel a positive energy in the whole house whilst she is preparing anything in
            the kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
            My second inspiration would be the guys at <a
                href="https://sorted.club/">https://sorted.club/</a>https://sorted.club/. My wife and I watch their
            videos on YouTube very often. Their website has a simple but fun structure, it was of inspiration when
            designing mine.
        </p>
        <p>
            My third inspiration would be a variety of other cooking and recipe websites. I did a lot of research to see
            how the most viewed website on the web as of today are structured. Websites such as: <a
                href="https://www.seriouseats.com/">https://www.seriouseats.com/</a>, <a
                href="https://www.hotforfoodblog.com/">https://www.hotforfoodblog.com/</a> and <a
                href="https://pinchofyum.com/">https://pinchofyum.com/</a> https://pinchofyum.com/ have all been of
            inspiration.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="report-container" id="accessibility">
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
            When designing and developing my website I wanted to be sure that accessibility was taken into account. I
            installed a chrome extension called "Screen Reader" (it can be found here <a
                href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en). ">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en).
            </a>https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en).
        </p>
        <p>
            This extension reads the content of a website and it's designed for people that are blind or have very
            little vision. I tried to navigate my website with my eyes closed using the extension. If I got stuck on the
            webpage I would change the design to make it more accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally I researched what makes a better alt text for images. I made sure that all recipe images have a
            good alt text.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally I added a feature that can change the website to dark mode. This mode makes the background dark and
            the text white so that people who have difficulties to read on white backgrounds can change nod to dark and
            have a better experience.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="report-container" id="usability">
        <h2>Usability</h2>
        <p>
            I made sure that the website is both mobile and pc friendly. I took in consideration and studied the
            responsiveness of the website. I made sure that all the media query would satisfy all possible, phones,
            tablets and PC screen sizes. The cards and content of the website changes design according to the width of
            the screen. Additionally on pc you have all the options to click, hover on links and cards while on mobile
            devices I added touch features on certain pages (such as swiping cards left or right in the dessert.html
            page).
        </p>
        <p>
            I developed my website with an aesthetic and minimalist design. By choosing a predetermined colour palette
            and using the recognizable card design, users should not find difficulty in browsing and searching what they
            are looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
            A third usability feature is a search bar at the top of each category. It can help user search for a
            particular recipe title or it can filter the recipe's by ingredients.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="report-container" id="learning">
        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript was one of the things I had to improve. To create the website in the way that I wanted, I wrote a
            lot of lines of JavaScript. At the beginning my JavaScript code were not optimal. By reworking many times my
            lines of code I have improved the quality of my code (hopefully).
        </p>
        <p>
            I had to research and learn what are the basic accessibility fundamentals. It was mind opening, reading from
            <a
                href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility">https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility</a>,
            how we design our websites can affect so many people. It's unfair that some people with disabilities would
            not have the possibility to enjoy your website if you did not take accessibility into consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another thing that I had to improve was my CSS knowledge. CSS can be a very powerful tool to make your
            website more dynamic. Whilst during the entirety of the module we learnt a lot about CSS, there are so many
            tips and tricks that can be found online to make some amazing styles for your website.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="report-container" id="evaluation1">
        <h2>Evaluation I</h2>
        <p>
            I am very happy of how I managed to create a template in basic JavaScript that will get the information from
            another .js file and then fill each page with the appropriate recipes. When designing the website, I wanted
            to make sure I could give a text file to my wife that she could easily fill with new recipes. I would then
            copy paste these recipes into the .js file called recipes.js. The first time I saw that the bakery page
            added my first six recipes automatically it was an amazing feeling of achievement. I am looking forward into
            the future to see how many recipes we will be able to add to the website.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="report-container" id="evaluation2">
        <h2>Evaluation II</h2>
        <p>
            One thing I am not too happy about is using stock images to complete the website. It's fundamental that you
            have good media on your website. My wife and I cooked all the recipes that are on the website but we haven't
            taken pictures of what we have cooked or the pictures are really not that good. I had to use free stock
            images to make the website more beautiful to look at. It is difficult to take good pictures of the food you
            prepare if you are not trained and if you don't have the right equipment. I am planning in the future to try
            and put all original pictures taken from me on the website.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="report-container" id="resources">
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>
            Here is a list of All the resources I used:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To write my code I used a software called "Visual Studio Code", it's a freeware source code editor.
            </li>
            <li>
                To upload my changes and see how they actually worked online I used GitHub and hosted the website on my
                personal page. By hosting on Github I could easily check both on desktop, tablet and phone how the
                website looked. I could then make cahnges to my CSS to make everything work well.
            </li>
            <li>
                I used the bootstrap library to help with some of the CSS and give me the fonts I like the most.
            </li>
            <li>
                I used jQuery library for my JavaScript. It helped a lot to select and modify Items.
            </li>
            <li>
                I have Google analytics connected to the website.
                This is for future use once the website will go live after getting the grade for the assignment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most of the images on the website are taken from:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.pexels.com/">https://www.pexels.com/</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://unsplash.com/">https://unsplash.com/</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://pixabay.com/">https://pixabay.com/</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/">https://www.shutterstock.com/</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>I used a software for image editing called "GIMP", to modify pictures and create icons.</li>
            <li>
                I used YouTube to host a video created by my wife and I. I then embeded this video in the desserts page
                into one of the recipe cards.
            </li>
            <li>To look for information for my Javascript and CSS I used the following websites:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">https://www.w3schools.com/</a></li>
                    <li><a
