        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Website is a portal where my wife and I can share our most loved recipes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of these recipes have been gathered through our years together and added in a little recipe book my wife cherishes very much. When I was asked in the module to create an actual website, I thought that it was the perfect occasion to bring all those recipes from the book to the web, so that we could share them with friends and family.
        </p>
        <p>
            When designing the website, I wanted to have a simple structure with a navigation Menu at the top and the content underneath it. The website has a home page and then 4 pages categorized by meal type (starters, main dishes, everything that is part of baking and desserts).
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to make sure that my wife and I could upload new recipes easily, so when designing the website, I created a template engine for the recipes. The recipes are found in a .js file called recipes.js and are saved as Objects. To add or remove a recipe it's sufficient to modify that .js file. When the webpage is loading it will load all the appropriate recipes from the file and the template engine in JavaScript will create a card for each recipe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recipes are loaded in each page as cards having a picture, a title, and a description of the recipe. If you click on the recipe card it will expand showing more in detail the ingredients and the steps to cook the recipe. All of the pictures come from freestock images websites or have been taken with a camera from me.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the bottom of the web page there is a standard footer. I followed my wife's preferences and chose a palette of greys, coral and white colours.

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
            My first inspiration would be my wife, she cooks amazing dishes for the whole family. Cooking is a great passion of hers and you can feel a positive energy in the whole house whilst she is preparing anything in the kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
            My second inspiration would be the guys at <a href="https://sorted.club/">https://sorted.club/</a>https://sorted.club/. My wife and I watch their videos on YouTube very often. Their website has a simple but fun structure, it was of inspiration when designing mine.
        </p>
        <p>
            My third inspiration would be a variety of other cooking and recipe websites. I did a lot of research to see how the most viewed website on the web as of today are structured. Websites such as: <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/">https://www.seriouseats.com/</a>, <a href="https://www.hotforfoodblog.com/">https://www.hotforfoodblog.com/</a> and <a href="https://pinchofyum.com/">https://pinchofyum.com/</a> https://pinchofyum.com/ have all been of inspiration.

        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
            When designing and developing my website I wanted to be sure that accessibility was taken into account. I installed a chrome extension called "Screen Reader" (it can be found here <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en). ">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en). </a>https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en). 
        </p>
        <p>
            This extension reads the content of a website and it's designed for people that are blind or have very little vision. I tried to navigate my website with my  eyes closed using the extension. If I got stuck on the webpage I would change the design to make it more accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally I researched what makes a better alt text for images. I made sure that all recipe images have a good alt text.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally I added a feature that can change the website to dark mode. This mode makes the background dark and the text white so that people who have difficulties to read on white backgrounds can change nod to dark and have a better experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Usability</h2>
        <p>
            I made sure that the website is both mobile and pc friendly. I took in consideration and studied the responsiveness of the website. I made sure that all the media query would satisfy all possible, phones, tablets and PC screen sizes. The cards and content of the website changes design according to the width of the screen. Additionally on pc you have all the options to click, hover on links and cards while on mobile devices I added touch features on certain pages (such as swiping cards left or right in the dessert.html page).
        </p>
        <p>
            I made sure that the website had an aesthetic and minimalist design. By choosing a predetermined colour palette and using the recognizable card design, users should not find difficulty in browsing and finding what they are looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
            A third usability feature is a search bar at the top of each category. It can help user search for a particular recipe title or it can filter the recipe's by ingredients.
